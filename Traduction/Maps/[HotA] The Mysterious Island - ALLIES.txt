Prologue
Message:
- {The Mysterious Island} - 	Project started in 2020 by Papyjama.		- PROLOGUE -	Prologue by "Monthly Python", a fan of the map who has played all 6 factions in v1.0 / v1.1:		"CHOOSING YOUR DIFFICULTY	Assuming you are playing on the highest difficulty, several factions are harder to work with than others.		{ORANGE} & {PURPLE} - Easy to defend, progression naturally tied to exploration. Recommended for first time players.		{GREEN} & {TAN} - Few paths you need to defend but still able to hold down a defensive position.		{TEAL} - You start pincered between 3 enemy factions on the island. Trying to get anywhere is challenging.		{BLUE} - This is the faction I decided to leave for my final playthrough, seeing their positioning on the map, the multiple routes that need to defend it, enemies from all sides, I don't recommend this for your first time playing this map."		--	Author's note :	In the version you’re playing (v{1}.{2}), the layout has been {improved}, along with the {balancing} between factions.		I hope you’ll enjoy the adventure!	{Papyjama}

Quelque peu obsede par le cul-te de Travia, la deesse pourtant tres serieuse du Foyer, on decouvrira sur le tard qu’il fut surtout un pretre de Raia, la deesse du Plaisir…! Il saurait benir ses adversaires a coup de gourdin et disposerait de quelques sorts de benediction pouvant etre utiles… mais cela reste a demontrer.

Un nain guerrier, neutre-bon (aux yeux de la Societe mais loyal-bon vis-a-vis du groupe) d’un metre quarante (et demi) quasiment indestructible (!) possedant une jambe metallique un peu bruyante ! Raleur, temeraire, bourru mais plutot sympathique, il dispose d’un lourd marteau magique particulierement efficace qu’il peut projeter sur ses adversaires... et recuperer par un effet boomerang !

Name:
Burrich
Biography:
Burrich is well-built, a quiet mountain of a man.	His face is narrow,square and tanned.	He has long-fingered and clever hands.	Burrich is mostly described by his few friends to be stubborn, honest, forthright and a little melancholic. He keeps his business to himself.	He is an impressive character: with only look and a quiet word, he used to keep a whole room full of rough men in discipline. As a younger man, Burrich injured his leg badly in a hunting accident, protecting Chivalry from a wild boar. It healed badly, and he still limps - his gruff and unfriendly nature is intensified when it is bothering him keenly; usually when rain is on the horizon. He is oddly sensitive about having it discussed, however, and will snap at anyone who comments about it.

Name:

When Vander, Felicia, Silco, and Connol led a rebellion against Piltover, her parents were killed in battle and Vander took the sisters in.	Vander later adopted two orphan boys as well, and Vi became the leader of their group.

Name:
Powder
Biography:
As a little girl, Powder was shy and sweet, but clumsy and prone to making mistakes. This, paired with a case of middle child syndrome, sparked irritation from her older "brother" Mylo, who referred to her as a jinx. She greatly admired her older sister Vi (her only biological family) and saw her as a role model and an almost parental figure. While not as physically capable as Vi, she was very creative and spent much of her spare time making different kinds of inventions, mostly {bombs} and other small {explosives}. However, they were predictably unreliable and were only effective later in her teens. She showed how skilled she was with a gun.

Biography:
Ayrton is a forty-five year old man.	With a harsh face, despite the thinness of his body, he seems endowed with great vigor, being all bones and nerves.	Of medium height, a frame of the shoulders developed, he has an intelligent and energetic figure where a brilliant gaze pierces under very sunken eyebrow arches.	Despite the hardness of his features and his determined appearance, his face attracts sympathy, where the stigmata of the suffering that he must be a man to endure can be guessed at.	His personality is obvious from the start and warns in his favor.
