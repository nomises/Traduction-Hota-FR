Day 1
Message:
The past few years have been relatively peaceful. Occasionally, you had to fight off attacks from pirates and savages, but there was little else to worry about. However, a few days ago, alarming news started coming from the south. First, a messenger arrived, reporting odd activity of lizardmen in the swamps. Then, a whole fleet of pirates arrived from the other side of the strait. Contrary to their habit, this time the pirates weren't interested in plundering coastal villages. They seemed to be fleeing in terror from something or someone. Several sea dogs got captured, but they were so scared you couldn't coerce any information out of them. Yesterday, a traveler from the southern lands visited you. He brought frightening news: a magical cataclysm had broken out in the land of wizards in the south. Now there are icy plains interspersed with patches of surviving vegetation where swamps used to be. The wanderer doesn't know why the wizards have done this, but one thing is clear: if they are not stopped now, the cataclysm will soon devour your pirate neighbors. And then, the storm of ice will reach you.

Message:
The scouts have discovered a town of the dead deep in the caves beneath our lands, ruled by a necromancer. The undead are not aggressive (at least they haven't appeared on the surface in years), but it's good that we know about this town now. Who knows when its dwellers may come in handy!

Name:
Day 16
Message:
Something intriguing has come to light. It seems that in the realm of wizards, there is a portal leading to a place where magical energy is concentrated. Perhaps this is where they draw the power they need to maintain the magical anomalies.

Name:
Day 27
Message:
Our scout, sent to the pirate lands a while ago, has returned with news. Some pirate sorcerers have recently returned to their fortress. It seems that they have been studying water magic in the distant lands of the hydromancers, and they have found a way to transport their troops across water without the use of ships!

Name:
Day 83
Message:
For the past few months, the wizards have been closely observing our actions. Now it seems they intend to march their forces north and strike first. The question is whether we will be ready.
