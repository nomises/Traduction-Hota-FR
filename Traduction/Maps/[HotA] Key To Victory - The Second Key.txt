Your enemy runs! Your enemy is terrified! Amid this chaos, your court's loyal sages managed to erect barriers along the entire contact line, encircling the remnants of the enemy host. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

Message:
Muster a powerful army and decide for yourself when to pass through the barriers for the final battle. Stand to horse!

Name:
day2
Message:
Your scouts report: some crucial mines with valuable resources are still held by the enemy. The scoundrel used summoning magic; the mines are now guarded by elementals. Still, you are going to need resources, and you can scarce allow the enemy's heroes, even summoned ones, to nose around your rear! While the risk of sabotage has been mitigated by the newly erected barriers, to defeat the elemental heroes remains your task to tackle.

day5
Message:
Your sentries have brought unexpected news. Anticipating his imminent downfall, your enemy has built his own barriers; only his own troops can pass through them. It seems as though you are now to find a new key to victory.

You're strolling along the forest's edge, pretending to hunt for mushrooms, but the leprechaun seems to have caught on to your presence. He narrows his eyes, and his dance becomes slower: he is prepared to pounce at you at any moment. As luck would have it, the telltale glint reveals the location of the leprechaun's treasure. Before the green prankster can reach you, you snatch a Celestial Necklace of Bliss out of a small stash.

Back in the day, mercenaries from all over the world would flock to these lands to join the mighty Legion's hosts. Even after his death, the monument to him kept stirring admiration in the hearts of both young soldiers and seasoned veterans. Today, however, only the base and legs of the great monument remain. Could you can find a way to restore the Statue of Legion?

The tall grass around the old cart hints at its long disuse. You carefully examine the cart: it misses one wheel, and a metal object props up its front axle. It is not without effort that you extract it: to your infinite surprise, it turns out to be the Lion's Shield of Courage.
