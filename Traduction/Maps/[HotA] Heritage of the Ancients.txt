Name:
Day 1 - Rampart
Message:
It took you a while to set up an outpost so far from your lands. Unfortunately, your actions did not go unnoticed. Soon, the ruler of a neighboring principality, your old enemy, arrived here too. This time, he hired an elementalist, who is equally eager to find out what secrets the tomb holds. However, you did not waste time either, enlisting the support of your old allies, the elves, who have long borne a grudge against your opponent.

This time, he enlisted the support of the elves, who have long borne a grudge against you for cutting down their forests. It seems that this lord is equally eager to find out what secrets the tomb holds. But you did not waste time either, meeting an experienced elementalist on the way, who offered his services to you. They say these sorcerers are capable of summoning an entire army!

Name:
Day 1 - Tower
Message:
Knowledge, power... What does this tomb have in store? We do not know, but who other than wizards from the University of the Four Elements can possibly unravel its secrets? It has been a long time since we had a chance to study the legacy of such ancient times. 	However, rumor has it that we are not the only ones who have learned of the Tomb's existence. The greedy rulers of neighboring lands woud never miss an opportunity to get their hands on treasures and new magic knowledge. Their troops will probably appear here soon, so we sent gargoyle messengers to them.

Name:
Day 6 (not Tower)
Message:
It seems that you and your enemy are not the only ones who know about the Tomb. A gargoyle flew into our camp today. Of course, the creature was shot on the spot, but it carried a message in its paws. 	A wizard, who introduced himself as a representative of some University, reported that he and his “colleagues” knew about both the Tomb and your plans. He warned about the dangers allegedly lurking in the Tomb and hinted that you had no business being there. 	Without saying a word, you tear up the letter and return to your men to give new orders.

Name:
Day 9 (Tower)
Message:
The gargoyles we sent with messages never returned, so we assume the worst; the rulers must have decided not only to settle their old scores, but also dared challenge us, ignoring our warning. So much the worse for them.

I’m but a lowly merchant, but not so long ago I came by a thing of great magic power. The vagabond who brought it to me said he had found it in the Tomb and had barely escaped with it, being chased by some odd monsters. I don't know if this is true, but the item is of no use to me. I would be happy to offer it to you for mere 15 gems.
No, I wouldn’t sell this for less than 15 gems. In different conditions, it could command a much higher price.
Great, here it is.	Do you want to buy the magic armor from the merchant?

I arrived here as a representative of the Circle of Druids. I want to study the creatures who settled down in the Tomb; who knows how a habitat like this influenced them? Bring me enough creatures so I could do research, and I will give you a magic scroll that would allow you to travel over water as easily as over land.
No, I need more creatures for my research. Return when you have enough of them.
Never thought I would have to study mummies like a filthy necromancer! Well, lore carries a price. I haven’t forgotten about your reward; take it.	Do you want to take the magic scroll from a druid?
